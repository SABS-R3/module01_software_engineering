Let's take each part in turn.\n",

    "\n",
    "\"Closed to modification\" means that a user of a class shouldn't need to change its behaviour. In other words, customisation is _only_ done by extension."

The application of this principle to object-oriented design relates to subclasses: a subclass should present the same behaviour as its parent when used as an instance of the parent class."

    "\n",
    "A client of an object should not depend on methods that it doesn't use.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.\n",
    "2. Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, these ideas are not too relevant to Python, which doesn't have a distinction between an abstraction (in object-oriented terms, an interface or protocol) and details (a class). The meaning of this principle is to isolate units by making them refer to abstract types rather than specific implementations. It's useful in testing, because you can introduce Mock Objects or other substitute dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "One place to consider the Dependency Inversion Principle in Python is when one class uses another class's static methods, or initialises objects from another class. Rather than naming the class explicitly at the place where you use it, make the class a property that you can change when needed."
