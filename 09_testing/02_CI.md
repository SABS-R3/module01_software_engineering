# Continuous Integration
- The practice of frequent and small merges of features
- Supported by automated building, testing and analysis of all branches
- Supports collaboration of large number of developers 

## Travis CI
- Online Continuous integration tool
- Integrates with Github
- Very easy to set-up. Minimal configuration files with defaults, which can over ridden if the code is built differently

Minimal Travis `.travis.yml` file for Python:
```$xslt
language: python
script:
  - pytest
```

Minimal Travis `.travis.yml` file for C++:
```$xslt
language: cpp
```

## Demonstration
Setting up travis for a Python project in GitHub

## Exercise 02.01
1. Create a .travis.yml file in your sandbox GitHub project
2. Sign-in to https://travis-ci.org/ with your GitHub credentials
3. Configure you project
4. Create a branch with a add a new unit that does not pass
5. Create pull request
6. Ensure you can see icon in the
7. Repeat steps 1 to 3 for your main project
