# Considerations

## Modes of delivery

## Secondary artefacts

## Versioning

* Software versions 

## API design

* API is the public face of your software.
  * People will use software with a good API and avoid software with a bad API
* Separate API from implementation
* Public APIs are forever - one chance to get it right.[^public_apis]

## Licenses

* Default open source license for projects is BSD 3
* Possible talk by open source license expert later in year
