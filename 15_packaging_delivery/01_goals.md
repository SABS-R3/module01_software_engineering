# Goal(s)

## End user point of view

* Make it easy for the end user to install and use your software
  * increase chances it'll be used
* Responsive release schedule with bug fixes, new features, etc
  * increase chances it'll continue to be used

## Developer point of view

* Painless packaging, release, and deployment process
* Reliable releases: eliminate errors during release process
* Reproducible releases

## Both

* Accelerated delivery
  * users get the software more quickly allowing developers to get user feedback
  * abandon, accelerate, or change direction of feature development based on user feedback

# Software projects - today's goals

> "Python’s flexibility is why the first step in every Python project must be to think about the
> project’s audience and the corresponding environment where the project will run. 
> It might seem strange to think about packaging before writing code, but this process
> does wonders for avoiding future headaches."[^headaches]

* Considerations for project packaging and delivery:
  * Expand above quote to thinking about the whole release process at the start of a project.
  * What to release?
  * How to release?
* CI/CD: release automation as an extension of CI
* Available tooling
* Application to your projects
