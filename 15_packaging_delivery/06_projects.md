# Projects

Questions to discuss and agree on as a group

* What development workflow to use?
* What are the release artefacts for our project?
* What is needed to produce those release artefacts?
* What will our CI/CD pipelines look like?

Development

* Set up and configure tooling
* Write pipelines:
  * View as code like any other. They will evolve over time.
  * Literally draw/sketch them first.
  * Start simple but not too simple.
  * Use NO-OP stages in pipelines and fill in later.
  * Get pipeline stage working outside CI/CD, on command line (not IDE), first
